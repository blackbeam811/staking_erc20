# ERC20Stakeable Smart Contract.
### The goal is to create a ERC20 Stakeable library easy to implement for any token.
### This Smart Contract is not Audited!

Created using [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) [ERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol) Smart Contract and [ERC20Burnable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Burnable.sol) extension.

Inspired by [Patrick Collins'](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC) [DeFi-minimal Staking.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/defi-minimal/blob/main/contracts/Staking.sol).


### Features for users:

1. Deposit the ERC20 Token and gain a fixed APR calculated hourly.
1. Compound your rewards.
1. Claim your rewards.
1. Withdraw a part of deposit.
1. Withdraw all(your deposit + rewards).

### Features for owner:

### Run test locally on Ganache


##### For unning local tests you also need: 
- [Ganache CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache-cli)
```
npm install -g ganache-cli
```
or, if you are using Yarn
```
yarn global add ganache-cli
```
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
To verify NodeJS installation run
```
node --version
```


##### Test scripts

- Run the command:
```
brownie test testes/test.py
```

The test will assert the following:
